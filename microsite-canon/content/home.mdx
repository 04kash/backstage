Welcome to the Canon, the new design library for Backstage plugins. This
project is still under active development but we will make sure to document
the API as we go. We are aiming to improve the general UI of Backstage and
plugins across Backstage. This new library will take time to build but we are
building it incrementally with not conflict with the existing theming system.

## Component Status

We are still in the process of documenting the API and building the
components. You can use the statuses below to see what is ready and what is
coming soon. If there is a component missing that you need, please let us know
by opening an issue on GitHub.

<ComponentStatus />
