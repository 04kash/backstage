This service allows your plugins to register new permissions, rules, and resource types and integrate with [the permissions framework](../../permissions/overview.md).

## Using the service

For a deep dive into how to use the `permissionIntegrations` service, see the [permission guide for plugin authors](../../permissions/plugin-authors/01-setup.md).

If all you want to do is add new custom permission rules to an existing plugin, you can instead refer to the [custom permission rules guide](../../permissions/custom-rules.md).
